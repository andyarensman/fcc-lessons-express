# FreeCodeCamp: APIs and Microservices Lessons - Basic Node and Express

FreeCodeCamp's introduction lessons to Node and Express, completed. This is part of the APIs and Microservices certification. You can find the lessons on [FreeCodeCamp here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/#basic-node-and-express)

Here is FreeCodeCamp's description of the lesson:
>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to write backend (server-side) programs in JavaScript. Node.js comes with a handful of built-in modules — small, independent programs — that help with this. Some of the core modules include HTTP, which acts like a server, and File System, a module to read and modify files.
>
>In the last set of courses you learned to install and manage packages from npm, which are collections of smaller modules. These packages can help you build larger, more complex applications.
>
>Express is a lightweight web application framework, and is one of the most popular packages on npm. Express makes it much easier to create a server and handle routing the routing for your application, which handles things like direct people to the correct page when they visit a certain endpoint like /blog.
>
>In this course, you'll learn the basics of Node and Express including how to create a server, serve different files, and handle different requests from the browser.
